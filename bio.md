# Hobbies

Hello, my name is Jason and some of my hobbies include snowboarding, playing basketball, and playing computer games. I also enjoy spending time with my wife and two kids (ages 6 and 3) 

I really enjoyed the projects in 161 and 162, although I took these classes at LBCC which was taught in JAVA. I also use to create HTML websites as part of my computer repair store that I ran for a number of years.
