# Hobbies

Hello, my name is Jason and some of my hobbies include snowboarding, playing basketball, and playing computer games. I also enjoy spending time with my wife and two kids (ages 6 and 3) 

I am hoping that I can figure out this GIT thing, it is very confusing and I am not sure what I am doing with it. I will play with it a bit more and see what I can figure out.
